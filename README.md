autotrading
===========

The purpose of this application is to simulate loss-stop trading. cause I can't find the loss-stop feature in almost all the trading 
application provided by brokers in china. 
Before I create this application, There are a lot 3rd party software use win32 APIs to manipulate the trading application with 
mouse/keyboard events. but no open source python implementation.

 1. Use win32 python library to send the mouse click event to trading application to make a selling deal.
 2. Added an algrithom to do loss-stop trading.
